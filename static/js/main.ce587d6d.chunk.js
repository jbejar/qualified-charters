We were the only school that had everyone do the training from the state auditor. We are down to about 400 kids so we are continuing to enroll kids. There are about 79-80 students that have chosen to do online. We have had to do some shuffling for online and in person students to balance things out. For every class except 6th we have 2 online teachers and 6th only has 1. We will need to assign seats in the lunchroom, recess is on a rotating schedule as far as where they can play in order to monitor contact tracing.

Requirement - 5 years ago Utah adopted a federal regulation that requires CO detection on all devices that use CO.  The system must be linked with our current Fire System.\\r\\n \\r\\n2.  Timeline - Firetrol has informed us that the timeline for completion is 8-12 weeks from start.  Drew have requested a timeline from AAA.\\r\\n\\r\\n3.  Scope - A CO detector must be installed in each of the 32 HVAC Units in the Elem and 16 units in the JH.  Each CO detector must have its own redundant Power Supply.  It cannot be added to the current power runs.  All COs must be linked to the fire panel and must be integrated with the alarm system in order to alert monitoring company and authorities of any issues.\\r\\n \\r\\n4. Financing - We may capitalize the expenditure.  This would essentially take it from reserves and wouldn\'t affect the bottom line on the audit all in one year.\\r\\n  CO Detector Procurement.pdf\\r\\n\\r\\nC.Crime Insurance\\r\\nVote\\tDebbie Deem\\t5 m\\r\\nThe Board voted in the June meeting to approve the crime insurance in lieu of the Treasurer\'s bond up to the increased premium amount of $500. We had not received the actual bid at that time. \\r\\n \\r\\nWe have received 2 options. \\r\\n$526,000 of Employee Theft coverage for $1,951.  The policies provides coverage for:\\r\\nGovernment entity including Treasurer (covers the position, no need for a specific bond)\\r\\nFaithful performance of duty (covers claims that the Treasurer didn\'t faithfully perform duties)\\r\\nAll employees - provides coverage if any employee who commits theft\\r\\n$526,000 Employee Theft coverage and only covers the Director, Board Chairman, Board Treasurer and the Business Manager.  It does not cover the other employees.  The premium for this option is $1,275\\r\\nThe Treasurer\'s bond premium was $895.  \\r\\n \\r\\nThe Utah Money Management Council recommends the Treasurer Bond amounts based upon the budget.  5% of our budget is about $465,000.  $526,000 is on the high side.  It is not recommended to reduce to the $465,000; however, we could lower the premium slightly if we wanted to lower the insured amount, possibly to $490,000 or $500,000.\\r\\n \\r\\n  Treasurer Bond Requirements.pdf\\r\\n\\r\\nD.Internet circuit upgrade\\r\\nVote\\tAndrew Smith\\t\\r\\nThrough UEN and E-rate, we are adding another circuit fail safe. We have a primary at WSU and the upgrade will give us a back up at UofU.\\r\\nOne time cost, after discount: $4,107.52.\\r\\nMonthly cost, after discount: $130.05 for a total of $7,803.00 over 60 months.\\r\\n  Please_DocuSign_Ogden_Prep_Academy_2020_MOU..pdf\\r\\n\\r\\nE.Medical Insurance Adoption and School contribution update\\r\\nVote\\tDebbie Deem\\t5 m\\r\\nWe currently offer Cigna medical insurance. They proposed a 20% premium increase, so we went to bid. Blue Cross/Blue Shield came back with the best rates.  For Dental and Vision, the bids were not as clear. TDA offers a savings to the most employees (35); however, it is a small increase to some (18).\\r\\nThe difference between Employee + Spouse and Employee + Children is not significant as it has been in the past. \\r\\nI am proposing we increase the school contribution to the Employee + Children category to $650 to match the Employee + Spouse category. With our current numbers this will cost approximately $6,000 per year.\\r\\nWe request a vote on the increased contribution.\\r\\n \\r\\nI have attached the current insurance costs and the proposed costs under the current benefit package.\\r\\n  FY21 Employee Insurance Costs - FY20.pdf\\r\\n  FY21 Employee Insurance Costs - FY21 (1).pdf\\r\\n  Medical Insurance Options.pdf\\r\\n\\r\\nF.Kitchen Equipment Grant\\r\\nVote\\tDebbie Deem\\t5 m\\r\\nWe applied for a Kitchen Equipment grant for $43,902.95.\\r\\nWe were awarded the grant to purchase the following:\\r\\nProofer Cabinet ($2,884.85)\\r\\nHot Food Serving Counter ($3,046.05)\\r\\nDisposers (2) ($4,346.54)\\r\\nCombi Oven ($28,027.55)\\r\\nTables (4) ($5,579.96)\\r\\n  OPA 2019 Equipment Assistance Grants Application applied 5-2020.pdf\\r\\n\\r\\nG.Grant for Wi-Fi upgrade\\r\\nVote\\tAndrew Smith\\t5 m\\r\\nThe UETN received a large grant from CARES for Wifi6 Upgrades. It is a very short project window. We were able to receive the grant to upgrade all of our Wireless Access Points to Wifi6. Unfortunately, the manufacturer that we went with in the E-Rate process does not release their Enterprise Wifi-6 Access Points until the end of 2020. In order to meet the requirements of this grant we had to go with a different manufacturer. This does not affect our E-Rate grant, it only allows us to move our installation schedule up. The LEA (OPA) must follow these project guidelines.\\r\\nMemorandum of Understanding must be signed by July 31st, 2020.\\r\\nProducts must be purchased by July 31st, 2020\\r\\nProducts must be installed and fully operational by December 30th, 2020.\\r\\nLEA (OPA) must purchase products and verify delivery before reimbursement can be provided.\\r\\nThere are weekly meetings and milestones that must be met throughout the entire project. I will be working closely with UETN to complete the project in the appropriate manner.\\r\\nIn addition to all Wireless Access Points being upgraded to Wifi6, UETN and USBE are working to standardize Wireless Monitoring. They are providing each LEA that was awarded this funding, a Wireless Monitoring System provided by Ekahau.\\r\\nThe total cost for the project is as follows:\\r\\nWireless Improvements - $76,317.74\\r\\na. 50 Meraki MR46 Wifi6 Access Points\\r\\nb. 13 Meraki MR56 Wifi6 Access Points\\r\\nc. 3 Meraki MR776-HW Outdoor Access Points\\r\\nd. 66 Meraki 6 Year Enterprise Licenses\\r\\nEkahau Package - $10,785.00\\r\\na. Ekahau Pro Suite\\r\\nb. Ekahau Sidekick\\r\\nc. 36 Months of Support\\r\\nd. 2 License seats for training through UEN.\\r\\nTotal Cost - $87,102.74\\r\\nThe way the E-Rate deal is structured, we have some flexibility with both product that we purchase, and timeframe of when we purchase.\\r\\nDue to the short window of opportunity and requirements of the funding project, and the fact that NetDiverse was selected for the E-Rate project of which this is an extension, we would like to use NetDiverse as the Service Provider for this project as well. NetDiverse is the only Service provider in Utah with Meraki Deal Registration on this deal, so they will receive the best discount for product.\\r\\nWe have a history of working with NetDiverse and they are currently our Tier 3 Support Provider. Attached is the NetDiverse Quote that was submitted as an estimate to UETN for the project.\\r\\nIf approved, the project will be completed by August 16th, 2020, and Ogden Preparatory Academy will have a fully operational Wifi6 Network for the 2020-2021 School Year.\\r\\n  OPA-Meraki AP Quote.pdf\\r\\n\\r\\nH.GEERs funding and CARES funding adjustments\\r\\nVote\\tDebbie Deem\\t5 m\\r\\nI.Cleaning and Sanitization Supply Ordering\\r\\nFYI\\tDebbie Deem\\t5 m\\r\\nIV.

School Revenue Bonds Form of Authorized Users update Vote Debbie Deem 3 m\\r\\nWe need to update the form with the correct titles and the new Board Chair.\\r\\nF. Property and Liability Insurance Vote Debbie Deem\\r\\nInsurance proposal from Jeff Hirst with American Insurance & Investment to continue our policy with Hanover.\\r\\nThe premium last year was $34,672 and the renewal premium this year is $34,792. Due to increasing school claims\\r\\nactivity, Hanover has changed their deductibles for Educators Legal Liability and Employment Practices to Loss and\\r\\nExpenses instead of Loss Only. This means we now pay legal costs from our deductible first. The property coverage also\\r\\nincreased by 4% as part of an inflation guard protocol to ensure we have adequate limits.\\r\\nWe have a Treasurer Bond in the amount of $526,000 in the name of Laura D\'Hulst. We can do a Crime Policy instead of\\r\\na Treasurer Bond. The advantage of the Crime policy is that it can provide more protection than what a bond can do. The\\r\\nCrime policy will also respond to Employee Theft claims and not go after the person bonded.\\r\\nWe need to vote on the acceptance of the proposed policy and whether we want a Treasurer\'s bond or the Crime Policy.\\r\\nG.
