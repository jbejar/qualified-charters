Please state your name for the official minutes. Please be mindful of the length of the board meeting and limit your comments to two minutes.\r\n2.\tAfter an item has been introduced and debated by the board, the President will call for Public comment on that item only.  Each public attendee shall have the opportunity to speak two times on the same issue on the same day.  It shall proceed that everyone will be given their first opportunity to speak before anyone will be given their second opportunity.\r\n3.\tTo maintain order, if someone from the public is out of order, the President will verbally counsel them by calling, 'point of order.'\r\n\r\nOrder of Debate\r\n1.\tThe item will be introduced by the sponsor if the sponsor is not present then the President will assign someone to do the introduction.\r\n2.\tMembers debate the item (unless no one wished to debate it).  Each member is allowed two separate opportunities to speak on the item.\r\n3.\tThe President will then open the item up for Public Comment following the directions in public comment section 2.\r\n4.\tThe item will then be opened up to the Board for additional debate if necessary.\r\n5.\tA member makes a motion by saying, 'I move that ' if it is long; it should be prepared in writing and given to the President or Secretary.  If no motion is made then the item dies, and no further debate will occur.  \r\n6.\tAnother board member may amend the motion.  If the motion is amended the President asks is their any objection to adopting the amendment.  If no objection is made, the chair may declare the amendment adopted.  If even one member objects, however the amendment is subject to debate and vote like any other motion.\r\n7.\tIf the motion is amended the President may open it up to further board comment if necessary.\r\n8.\tThe President will then call the question and take a vote on the item.\r\n9.\tThe President announces the vote.\r\n\r\nPattern of Formality\r\n1.\tThe President should be addressed as Mister or Madam President as appropriate.\r\n2.\tWait to be acknowledged verbally or with a nod before speaking by the President.\r\n3.\tSpeak only to the President or though him/her.\r\n4.\tAvoid personalizing any issue; speak to the subject, not the person you disagree with.  An example of this would be if you believe something said to be untrue, you would say, I believe the member is mistaken instead of saying something was a lie.\r\n5.\tIf anyone breeches Robert's Rules or for example speaks out of turn, it is called a point of order and will be corrected by the President or any other board member that catches it.  One would say, 'Point of Order' The President would acknowledge the person and they would say what breech occurred.  The President would then say 'the point of order is well taken' or in unfounded, 'the point of order is not well taken.\r\n\r\nQuestions Board Members Consider When Making Decisions\r\n1.\tHow will the decision affect the school?\r\n2.\tHow does this decision relate to our mission statement and philosophy?\r\n3.\tWhat's the potential for legal problems if I vote yes?  What if I vote no?\r\n4.\tDoes this decision affect:\r\na.\tThe students and families we serve?  How?\r\nb.\tLakeview Academy's staff?  How?\r\nc.\tThe community?   How?\r\nd.\tThe Board of Trustees itself?   How?\r\nIs the impact on any of these groups negative?  If it is, will the decision benefit significantly more people than it will harm?\r\n5.\tHave we voted on this matter before?  If yes, why are we considering it again?  How have the conditions changes?\r\n6.\tDo I have all the information I need to make a sound decision?  What questions should I ask before making this decision?\r\n7.\tIf someone asked me to justify why I made this decision, can I explain my decision?",

Please state your name for the official minutes. Please be mindful of the length of the board meeting and limit your comments to two minutes.\r\n2.\tAfter an item has been introduced and debated by the board, the President will call for Public comment on that item only.  Each public attendee shall have the opportunity to speak two times on the same issue on the same day.  It shall proceed that everyone will be given their first opportunity to speak before anyone will be given their second opportunity.\r\n3.\tTo maintain order, if someone from the public is out of order, the President will verbally counsel them by calling, 'point of order.'\r\n\r\nOrder of Debate\r\n1.\tThe item will be introduced by the sponsor if the sponsor is not present then the President will assign someone to do the introduction.\r\n2.\tMembers debate the item (unless no one wished to debate it).  Each member is allowed two separate opportunities to speak on the item.\r\n3.\tThe President will then open the item up for Public Comment following the directions in public comment section 2.\r\n4.\tThe item will then be opened up to the Board for additional debate if necessary.\r\n5.\tA member makes a motion by saying, 'I move that ' if it is long; it should be prepared in writing and given to the President or Secretary.  If no motion is made then the item dies, and no further debate will occur.  \r\n6.\tAnother board member may amend the motion.  If the motion is amended the President asks is their any objection to adopting the amendment.  If no objection is made, the chair may declare the amendment adopted.  If even one member objects, however the amendment is subject to debate and vote like any other motion.\r\n7.\tIf the motion is amended the President may open it up to further board comment if necessary.\r\n8.\tThe President will then call the question and take a vote on the item.\r\n9.\tThe President announces the vote.\r\n\r\nPattern of Formality\r\n1.\tThe President should be addressed as Mister or Madam President as appropriate.\r\n2.\tWait to be acknowledged verbally or with a nod before speaking by the President.\r\n3.\tSpeak only to the President or though him/her.\r\n4.\tAvoid personalizing any issue; speak to the subject, not the person you disagree with.  An example of this would be if you believe something said to be untrue, you would say, I believe the member is mistaken instead of saying something was a lie.\r\n5.\tIf anyone breeches Robert's Rules or for example speaks out of turn, it is called a point of order and will be corrected by the President or any other board member that catches it.  One would say, 'Point of Order' The President would acknowledge the person and they would say what breech occurred.  The President would then say 'the point of order is well taken' or in unfounded, 'the point of order is not well taken.\r\n\r\nQuestions Board Members Consider When Making Decisions\r\n1.\tHow will the decision affect the school?\r\n2.\tHow does this decision relate to our mission statement and philosophy?\r\n3.\tWhat's the potential for legal problems if I vote yes?  What if I vote no?\r\n4.\tDoes this decision affect:\r\n   a.\tThe students and families we serve?  How?\r\n   b.\tLakeview Academy's staff?  How?\r\n   c.\tThe community?   How?\r\n   d.\tThe Board of Trustees itself?   How?\r\nIs the impact on any of these groups negative?  If it is, will the decision benefit significantly more people than it will harm?\r\n5.\tHave we voted on this matter before?  If yes, why are we considering it again?  How have the conditions changes?\r\n6.\tDo I have all the information I need to make a sound decision?  What questions should I ask before making this decision?\r\n7.\tIf someone asked me to justify why I made this decision, can I explain my decision?",

We only charge for extra curricular activities. Next year we will not be able to charge textbook fees. The fees that we receive for activities go directly back into the program for which they were received. Anything leftover can go into the school general fund. Our policy comes pretty much from the outline from the state as does our waiver. Mr. Schellhous is the fee administrator. \r\nNoted that the fee schedule has been reviewed for the first time. \r\n\r\nAdjourn",

Ms. Bayless has to leave and we have made some adjustments to fill her void in the math department. We don't anticipate any other staff changes through the end of the year.  Covid update: we currently have no staff quarantined and we have 8 students on quarantine and none of them have tested positive. 3 come off tomorrow. \r\n**Aaron Goodrich had to leave**\r\nMr. Wood had questions about the attrition reports.

The removal of the APs from the E-rate plan enables us to use Meraki for the same budget. The E-rate plan allows us to make this change as well. We are not changing vendors.\r\n \r\nRecommended for Board vote: \r\nApproval of updated timeline with the installation of Meraki hardware. See attached sheet for the original timeline and the proposed timeline.\r\n FY 20 Erate Bid Information - Frubu Graphic overview.pdf\r\n FY 20 Erate Bid Information - Frubu Timeline old and new.pdf\r\n Meraki Network Narrative.pdf\r\n\r\nC.Copy Machine Purchase\r\nVote\tDebbie Deem\t5 m\r\nWe have been leasing one of our copy machines in conjunction with paying off a previous unpaid service bill. The service debt and the lease are up in March. We propose the purchase of a replacement copy machine. \r\nCopy Machine: $12,248.00\r\nService Debt payoff: $1,943.37\r\nTotal: $14,191.37\r\n(additional $594.43 to ship the old machine back to the warehouse)\r\n Ogden Prep Academy M905_.pdf\r\n\r\nD.Garbage and Recycling Contract\r\nVote\tDebbie Deem\t5 m\r\nThe contract for Garbage and Recycling with Republic Services is up for renewal. We solicited bids from 4 companies for the service, see procurement paperwork attached. \r\n \r\nAll bids are lower than the current rate we are paying. Ace Disposal has presented the lowest cost and confirmed no additional charges will be included. \r\n \r\nDisclaimer: Ace Disposal handles the garbage services for Debbie Deem's apartment business; however, there is no benefit to her or her business for choosing Ace Disposal.

School Update\t4:55 PM\r\nA.Pandemic Related School Schedule\r\nVote\tWilliam Davis\t10 m\r\nAs we prepare to move into second semester, we need to determine what the schedule will be.\r\nPreviously the Board approved the following for Semester 1:\r\nJunior High: staggered attendance Monday through Thursday with remote learning on Friday.\r\nElementary: In person learning Monday through Thursday with remote learning on Friday.\r\nRecommendation for Board Vote:\r\nOriginally  we were anticipating an improvement in the pandemic situation; however, due to the increase in COVID cases and quarantines, the Administration asks that the Board approve the continuation of the current school schedule through Semester 2. Although the schedule for in person students will remain the same, both buildings will work to allow online students to move to in-person by request. Should the pandemic situation improve, the schedule may be revisited. \r\nB.Quarantine Policy Discussion\r\nVote\tDebbie Deem\t10 m\r\nThe policy has been attached with redlines for Administrative suggested edits.\r\n \r\nDiscussion (The Administration has not made a determination on the following; any decisions made by the Board shall be reflected in the Policy update):\r\nThe CDC/Utah Health Department has recommended reducing the quarantine time for exposure from 14 days to 10 days. Attached is the data we have from the quarantined staff at school related to this timeline.\r\nThe CDC has stated that there is no need to quarantine 90 days after recovering from COVID. \r\nTravel related quarantines in conjunction with any changes to the 14 days or 90 day information.\r\nPolicy Management: Do we want to continue to make all changes dependent of Board vote, or do we want a caveat for change in relation to CDC or Health Department recommendations?\r\nWebsites related to this discussion:\r\nUtah Coronavirus information page: https://coronavirus.utah.gov/protect-yourself/?fbclid=IwAR2zb4ds9QE9mEmVrDInUc7PquQypErq5x-CypDraEoanIsmWIvOiuuaR2Y\r\nCDC: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/duration-isolation.html\r\nAttachments:\r\nEmail from Weber-Morgan Health Department nurse assigned to OPA.\r\nData from survey to quarantined staff.\r\n 6.27.POL COVID-19 Quarantine Policy - Google Docs.pdf\r\n FY21 12-2020 Staft Quarantine Survey - Sheet1.pdf\r\n Quarantine email from Public Health Nurse regarding quarantine time.pdf\r\n\r\nC.Administrative Board Report\r\nDiscuss\tKasey Kennington\t20 m\r\n Administrative Board Report 12.10.2020.pdf\r\n FY21 Safety Review - Sheet1.pdf\r\n LiveScan Fingerprinting Procurement Comparison 11-10-2020.pdf\r\n\r\nD.Executive Session to Discuss Directors' Evaluations and Bonus recommendations.\r\nVote\tWilliam Davis\t5 m\r\nto protect the privacy of an individual.\r\nE.Administrative Fall Evaluations and Bonus Proposal\r\nVote\tWilliam Davis\t5 m\r\nVI.

Targeting at risk or struggling students\r\n-\tIncreasing student activities\r\n-\tHired a full time social worker at Highland, sharing the therapy services between SPA and Highland\r\n-\tRamping up college prep activities, some students looking out of state, some considering a gap year; reengaging former students who took gap years to reapply this coming year\r\nAdministrative Report: Lucas Charon \r\n-\tStudents doing better in Q2 vs Q1, still too many students At Risk (one or more Fs)\r\n-\tCOVID Update - District directing that they'll wait until teachers complete vaccinations before returning to school.  If we're delayed in the vaccinations, yet the District has completed their process and decided to come back, Board may need to make a decision on whether SPA will return - should be after next Board meeting\r\n-\tEnrollment at 225, holding steady.  35 new students interested in attending next year.

Not all faculty reported to him\r\n-\tWith a viable vaccine coming, thoughts on coming back on site - Most willing and eager to get vaccine and return on site.  Hybrid learning - generally unfavorably viewed by teachers.  Would rather go one or the other way exclusively\r\n-\tAnything else for the Board - Nothing notable, appreciate the Board's and administration's efforts and support.

Building is falling apart, looks wragtag.  Why leave their beautiful, well funded local school and come to SPA.  Instagram has no pictures of kids, not geared towards kids.

Should still encourage donating to specific departments or purposes\r\n-\tLucas to set up committee meetings to facilitate further actions, for all committees\r\n-\tCassie to convene a committee meeting, with Steve B in the wings\r\nExternal Relationship Development Committee Update - Tracy Evans\r\n-\tHale has created outreach videos, forward to Lucas who can distribute to teachers\r\n-\tBrainstorming on possible master classes, including audition training (online and in person), resume writing, career evaluation and self-marketing, headshot offerings, bring in Broadway experienced performers to advise, makeup/wigs, voice over work.

Motion approved\r\n-\tUpdate SPA logo on these and other SPA published materials\r\n\r\nSBO Report: Tess Miller\r\n-\tPlanning online events through March\r\n-\tNeed Board help for after school workshops, Tracy and Kit may help, consider jobs/activities after graduation\r\n-\tBackpack project - preparing for next school year\r\n-\tJohn C - Student video progress?  Discussing this week, will report back\r\nCounselor Report: Willow Amendola\r\n-\tSchool registration for next school year begun, including parent meetings\r\n-\tPreparing for ACTs on March 9th\r\n-\tOne junior graduating as a senior; moving to LA\r\n-\tStarted home visits by administration, ramping up advisory activities.  Targeting at risk or struggling students\r\n-\tIncreasing student activities\r\n-\tHired a full time social worker at Highland, sharing the therapy services between SPA and Highland\r\n-\tRamping up college prep activities, some students looking out of state, some considering a gap year; reengaging former students who took gap years to reapply this coming year\r\nAdministrative Report: Lucas Charon \r\n-\tStudents doing better in Q2 vs Q1, still too many students At Risk (one or more Fs)\r\n-\tCOVID Update - District directing that they'll wait until teachers complete vaccinations before returning to school.  If we're delayed in the vaccinations, yet the District has completed their process and decided to come back, Board may need to make a decision on whether SPA will return - should be after next Board meeting\r\n-\tEnrollment at 225, holding steady.  35 new students interested in attending next year.  Ads on social media appear to be working\r\n\r\nFinancial Report: Britni Manning\r\n-\tReviewed overview stats and trends only, referring to detailed reports that were distributed\r\n-\tFiscal 2019/2020 Final Audit Report reviewed, with finding, drafted a response to the State\r\n-\tBudget update deferred to next Board meeting\r\n-\tPPP loan being considered, will move forward with an application then review and approve next meeting\r\n-\tAdditional grant money expected beyond budgeted\r\nPTO Update - None\r\nFaculty Report: Varlo Davenport\r\n-\tNot just surviving, but thriving\r\n-\tClass Engagement - More intensive classes, high engagement.  SPA academic classes, a struggle; appears to skew towards freshman.\r\n-\t% of Students logging in - 85%+ on average. A different message from last meeting where reported severe lack of engagement.  Appears to have turned the corner.  May be in part survey error - i.e. Dance faculty skewed the favorable trends and results.  Not all faculty reported to him\r\n-\tWith a viable vaccine coming, thoughts on coming back on site - Most willing and eager to get vaccine and return on site.  Hybrid learning - generally unfavorably viewed by teachers.  Would rather go one or the other way exclusively\r\n-\tAnything else for the Board - Nothing notable, appreciate the Board's and administration's efforts and support.

Building is falling apart, looks wragtag.  Why leave their beautiful, well funded local school and come to SPA.  Instagram has no pictures of kids, not geared towards kids.

Estimated average contribution of $45-50\r\n-\tNext, roll out appeal letters in April to prep for Fall\r\n-\tContributions go directly to SPA, a non-profit 501c3\r\n-\tTrack and classify donations to specific departments, although not legally restricted.  Should still encourage donating to specific departments or purposes\r\n-\tLucas to set up committee meetings to facilitate further actions, for all committees\r\n-\tCassie to convene a committee meeting, with Steve B in the wings\r\nExternal Relationship Development Committee Update - Tracy Evans\r\n-\tHale has created outreach videos, forward to Lucas who can distribute to teachers\r\n-\tBrainstorming on possible master classes, including audition training (online and in person), resume writing, career evaluation and self-marketing, headshot offerings, bring in Broadway experienced performers to advise, makeup/wigs, voice over work.

Due to Chair Hafen's determination contained in the body of the below agenda, the public meeting will be held electronically via Zoom and live streamed on THSA's YouTube channel.  Public meetings conducted via Zoom may be terminated at any time due to hackers or inappropriate content.\r\n \r\nMeetings of the Board may be conducted via electronic means pursuant to Utah Code Ann. 52-4-209(2)(a) and 52-4-207(4), as amended.  \r\n \r\nThe THSA Board, in compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act, provides accommodations and services for those members of the public in need of assistance.  Persons requesting these accommodations for the above-scheduled public hearing should contact Kent Brown at kbrown@tuacahnhs.org or 435-652-3303, giving at least 24 hours' notice prior to the meeting. \r\n \r\nAGENDA\r\n \r\n1. Welcome and Roll Call\r\n \r\n2. Chair's Determination Letter.  In accordance with Utah Code 54-2-209 and 52-4-207(4) and of the Utah Open and Public Meeting Act, I have determined that conducting an electronic meeting of the THSA Board with an anchor location presents a substantial risk to the health and safety of those who may be present at the anchor location.  This determination is based on the facts and circumstances surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic.  Considering the continued number of COVID-19 case counts in Utah, meeting at an anchor location presents substantial risk to the health and safety of those in attendance because physical distancing measures may be difficult to maintain at the anchor location.\r\n\r\nWatch via YouTube Link: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcGR1APVDgBwCUmvuPGicOA\r\n \r\nJoin via Zoom Meeting: \r\n\r\nTime: Mar 1, 2021 05:00 PM Mountain Time (US and Canada)\r\n\r\nJoin Zoom Meeting\r\nhttps://us02web.zoom.us/j/83728133555?pwd=ZlJTRFR0dUMrdjJPcm94cm8wT0hGdz09\r\n\r\nMeeting ID: 837 2813 3555\r\nPasscode: 815775\r\nOne tap mobile\r\n+13462487799,,83728133555# US (Houston)\r\n+16699009128,,83728133555# US (San Jose)\r\n\r\nDial by your location\r\n        +1 346 248 7799 US (Houston)\r\n        +1 669 900 9128 US (San Jose)\r\n        +1 253 215 8782 US (Tacoma)\r\n        +1 312 626 6799 US (Chicago)\r\n        +1 646 558 8656 US (New York)\r\n        +1 301 715 8592 US (Washington DC)\r\n\r\nMeeting ID: 837 2813 3555\r\nFind your local number: https://us02web.zoom.us/u/kd1jfBdLTR\r\n \r\n3.

Due to Chair Hafen&#39;s determination\r\ncontained in the body of the below agenda, the public meeting will be held electronically via Zoom and\r\nlive streamed on THSA&#39;s YouTube channel.  Public meetings conducted via Zoom may be terminated at\r\nany time due to hackers or inappropriate content.\r\n \r\nMeetings of the Board may be conducted via electronic means pursuant to Utah Code Ann. 52-4-\r\n209(2)(a) and 52-4-207, as amended. \r\n \r\nMembers of the public wishing to provide written comment in advance of the meeting may send their\r\ncomments to Kent Brown, kbrown@tuacahnhs.org, 1100 Tuacahn Drive, Ivins, UT 84738.\r\n \r\nMembers of the public wishing to provide comment at the meeting should sign up to submit their\r\ncomments by contacting Kent Brown at kbrown@tuacahnhs.org or 435-652-3303.\r\n \r\nPlease note that in order to allow afford all interested members the opportunity to speak, comments\r\nwill be limited to 2 minutes.  Interested members who wish to provide more extensive comments are\r\ninvited to submit written comments to Kent Brown in advance of the meeting.\r\n \r\nThe THSA Board, in compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act, provides accommodations and\r\nservices for those members of the public in need of assistance.  Persons requesting these\r\naccommodations for the above-scheduled public hearing should contact Kent Brown at\r\nkbrown@tuacahnhs.org or 435-652-3303, giving at least 24 hours&#39; notice prior to the meeting.\r\n \r\nAGENDA\r\n \r\n1. Roll Call\r\n \r\n2. Chair&#39;s Determination Letter.  In accordance with Utah Code 52-4-209(2)(a) and 52-4-207(4) of the\r\nUtah Open and Public Meeting Act, I have determined that conducting an electronic meeting of the\r\nTHSA Board with an anchor location presents a substantial risk to the health and safety of those who\r\nmay be present at the anchor location.  This determination is based on the facts and circumstances\r\nsurrounding the COVID-10 pandemic.  Considering the continued number of COVID-10 case counts in\r\nUtah, meeting in an anchor location presents substantial risk to the health and safety of those in\r\nattendance because physical distancing measures may be difficult to maintain at the anchor location.\r\nWatch via YouTube Link: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcGR1APVDgBwCUmvuPGicOA\r\n \r\nJoin via Zoom Meeting:\r\nTopic: Meeting of the Board of Tuacahn High School for the Performing Arts\r\nTime: Feb 22, 2021 06:00 PM Mountain Time (US and Canada)\r\nJoin Zoom Meeting\r\nhttps://us02web.zoom.us/j/86165117787?pwd=bmhGUGhPbmQrUDRnZDJMWjBzd21sQT09\r\n\r\nMeeting ID: 861 6511 7787\r\nPasscode: 945429\r\nOne tap mobile\r\n+12532158782,,86165117787# US (Tacoma)\r\n+13462487799,,86165117787# US (Houston)\r\nDial by your location\r\n        +1 253 215 8782 US (Tacoma)\r\n        +1 346 248 7799 US (Houston)\r\n        +1 669 900 9128 US (San Jose)\r\n        +1 301 715 8592 US (Washington DC)\r\n        +1 312 626 6799 US (Chicago)\r\n        +1 646 558 8656 US (New York)\r\nMeeting ID: 861 6511 7787\r\nFind your local number: https://us02web.zoom.us/u/kcWzunqiiq\r\n3.

Following public comment, the Chair intends to invite the Board to go into closed session pursuant to\r\nUtah Code Ann. 52-4-205(1)(a), which allows for closed meetings to discuss &quot;the character, professional\r\ncompetence, or physical or mental health of an individual.&quot;\r\n \r\n6.
