We are hopeful we will be able to go back to our regular schedule and not offering an online option.  Online has been difficult on students and teachers. We are still negotiating with the second grade teacher. We feel like she will fit in well with the culture of Odyssey and are encouraged by how well she is fitting what we would like to see. Ms. Bayless has to leave and we have made some adjustments to fill her void in the math department. We don't anticipate any other staff changes through the end of the year.

The removal of the APs from the E-rate plan enables us to use Meraki for the same budget. The E-rate plan allows us to make this change as well. We are not changing vendors.\r\n \r\nRecommended for Board vote: \r\nApproval of updated timeline with the installation of Meraki hardware.

School Update\t4:55 PM\r\nA.Pandemic Related School Schedule\r\nVote\tWilliam Davis\t10 m\r\nAs we prepare to move into second semester, we need to determine what the schedule will be.\r\nPreviously the Board approved the following for Semester 1:\r\nJunior High: staggered attendance Monday through Thursday with remote learning on Friday.\r\nElementary: In person learning Monday through Thursday with remote learning on Friday.\r\nRecommendation for Board Vote:\r\nOriginally  we were anticipating an improvement in the pandemic situation; however, due to the increase in COVID cases and quarantines, the Administration asks that the Board approve the continuation of the current school schedule through Semester 2. Although the schedule for in person students will remain the same, both buildings will work to allow online students to move to in-person by request. Should the pandemic situation improve, the schedule may be revisited. \r\nB.Quarantine Policy Discussion\r\nVote\tDebbie Deem\t10 m\r\nThe policy has been attached with redlines for Administrative suggested edits.\r\n \r\nDiscussion (The Administration has not made a determination on the following; any decisions made by the Board shall be reflected in the Policy update):\r\nThe CDC/Utah Health Department has recommended reducing the quarantine time for exposure from 14 days to 10 days.

She estimates approx. ~15% of students may test flat or regress based on teacher input.\r\nChristy reports SGA had the first positive COVID-19 case this week.
