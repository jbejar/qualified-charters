Covid update: we are planning on applying for more funds and we plan to use that money to try to get closer to the 1:1 tech ratio. Most of our faculty have been vaccinated or have been working on getting things scheduled. Parent and teacher surveys have been sent out. Teachers are pretty evenly split on end time for next year. Administration recommends getting back to normal time. Data will be presented next time for the parent input. When asked what teachers would like to see changed, curriculum is one that is brought up frequently, specifically Saxon so that is something we are going to look at possibly changing.

The removal of the APs from the E-rate plan enables us to use Meraki for the same budget. The E-rate plan allows us to make this change as well. We are not changing vendors.\r\n \r\nRecommended for Board vote: \r\nApproval of updated timeline with the installation of Meraki hardware.

School Update\t4:55 PM\r\nA.Pandemic Related School Schedule\r\nVote\tWilliam Davis\t10 m\r\nAs we prepare to move into second semester, we need to determine what the schedule will be.\r\nPreviously the Board approved the following for Semester 1:\r\nJunior High: staggered attendance Monday through Thursday with remote learning on Friday.\r\nElementary: In person learning Monday through Thursday with remote learning on Friday.\r\nRecommendation for Board Vote:\r\nOriginally  we were anticipating an improvement in the pandemic situation; however, due to the increase in COVID cases and quarantines, the Administration asks that the Board approve the continuation of the current school schedule through Semester 2. Although the schedule for in person students will remain the same, both buildings will work to allow online students to move to in-person by request. Should the pandemic situation improve, the schedule may be revisited. \r\nB.Quarantine Policy Discussion\r\nVote\tDebbie Deem\t10 m\r\nThe policy has been attached with redlines for Administrative suggested edits.\r\n \r\nDiscussion (The Administration has not made a determination on the following; any decisions made by the Board shall be reflected in the Policy update):\r\nThe CDC/Utah Health Department has recommended reducing the quarantine time for exposure from 14 days to 10 days.

Motion approved\r\n-\tUpdate SPA logo on these and other SPA published materials\r\n\r\nSBO Report: Tess Miller\r\n-\tPlanning online events through March\r\n-\tNeed Board help for after school workshops, Tracy and Kit may help, consider jobs/activities after graduation\r\n-\tBackpack project - preparing for next school year\r\n-\tJohn C - Student video progress?  Discussing this week, will report back\r\nCounselor Report: Willow Amendola\r\n-\tSchool registration for next school year begun, including parent meetings\r\n-\tPreparing for ACTs on March 9th\r\n-\tOne junior graduating as a senior; moving to LA\r\n-\tStarted home visits by administration, ramping up advisory activities.  Targeting at risk or struggling students\r\n-\tIncreasing student activities\r\n-\tHired a full time social worker at Highland, sharing the therapy services between SPA and Highland\r\n-\tRamping up college prep activities, some students looking out of state, some considering a gap year; reengaging former students who took gap years to reapply this coming year\r\nAdministrative Report: Lucas Charon \r\n-\tStudents doing better in Q2 vs Q1, still too many students At Risk (one or more Fs)\r\n-\tCOVID Update - District directing that they'll wait until teachers complete vaccinations before returning to school.  If we're delayed in the vaccinations, yet the District has completed their process and decided to come back, Board may need to make a decision on whether SPA will return - should be after next Board meeting\r\n-\tEnrollment at 225, holding steady.  35 new students interested in attending next year.

SPA academic classes, a struggle; appears to skew towards freshman.\r\n-\t% of Students logging in - 85%+ on average. A different message from last meeting where reported severe lack of engagement.  Appears to have turned the corner.  May be in part survey error - i.e. Dance faculty skewed the favorable trends and results.  Not all faculty reported to him\r\n-\tWith a viable vaccine coming, thoughts on coming back on site - Most willing and eager to get vaccine and return on site.  Hybrid learning - generally unfavorably viewed by teachers.  Would rather go one or the other way exclusively\r\n-\tAnything else for the Board - Nothing notable, appreciate the Board's and administration's efforts and support.

Building is falling apart, looks wragtag.  Why leave their beautiful, well funded local school and come to SPA.  Instagram has no pictures of kids, not geared towards kids.

Should still encourage donating to specific departments or purposes\r\n-\tLucas to set up committee meetings to facilitate further actions, for all committees\r\n-\tCassie to convene a committee meeting, with Steve B in the wings\r\nExternal Relationship Development Committee Update - Tracy Evans\r\n-\tHale has created outreach videos, forward to Lucas who can distribute to teachers\r\n-\tBrainstorming on possible master classes, including audition training (online and in person), resume writing, career evaluation and self-marketing, headshot offerings, bring in Broadway experienced performers to advise, makeup/wigs, voice over work.

If we're delayed in the vaccinations, yet the District has completed their process and decided to come back, Board may need to make a decision on whether SPA will return - should be after next Board meeting\r\n-\tEnrollment at 225, holding steady.  35 new students interested in attending next year.

This determination is based on the facts and circumstances surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic.  Considering the continued number of COVID-19 case counts in Utah, meeting at an anchor location presents substantial risk to the health and safety of those in attendance because physical distancing measures may be difficult to maintain at the anchor location.\r\n\r\nWatch via YouTube Link: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcGR1APVDgBwCUmvuPGicOA\r\n \r\nJoin via Zoom Meeting: \r\n\r\nTime: Mar 1, 2021 05:00 PM Mountain Time (US and Canada)\r\n\r\nJoin Zoom Meeting\r\nhttps://us02web.zoom.us/j/83728133555?pwd=ZlJTRFR0dUMrdjJPcm94cm8wT0hGdz09\r\n\r\nMeeting ID: 837 2813 3555\r\nPasscode: 815775\r\nOne tap mobile\r\n+13462487799,,83728133555# US (Houston)\r\n+16699009128,,83728133555# US (San Jose)\r\n\r\nDial by your location\r\n        +1 346 248 7799 US (Houston)\r\n        +1 669 900 9128 US (San Jose)\r\n        +1 253 215 8782 US (Tacoma)\r\n        +1 312 626 6799 US (Chicago)\r\n        +1 646 558 8656 US (New York)\r\n        +1 301 715 8592 US (Washington DC)\r\n\r\nMeeting ID: 837 2813 3555\r\nFind your local number: https://us02web.zoom.us/u/kd1jfBdLTR\r\n \r\n3.
