The board may comment on issues raised during this period, but State law does not allow the board to take final action on issues raised during this time unless they are already on the agenda for a vote (USC-52-4-202 6c). \r\nSchool performance (15 minutes)\r\nDirectors report We just finished our onsite audit from Squire & Co and so far things are looking good. We were the only school that had everyone do the training from the state auditor. We are down to about 400 kids so we are continuing to enroll kids. There are about 79-80 students that have chosen to do online. We have had to do some shuffling for online and in person students to balance things out. For every class except 6th we have 2 online teachers and 6th only has 1. We will need to assign seats in the lunchroom, recess is on a rotating schedule as far as where they can play in order to monitor contact tracing. We are changing carpool protocol and assign each family a number that will bring up the students' names so that they can come out directly. Assessments will be the first 3 days.

School Update\t4:55 PM\r\nA.Pandemic Related School Schedule\r\nVote\tWilliam Davis\t10 m\r\nAs we prepare to move into second semester, we need to determine what the schedule will be.\r\nPreviously the Board approved the following for Semester 1:\r\nJunior High: staggered attendance Monday through Thursday with remote learning on Friday.\r\nElementary: In person learning Monday through Thursday with remote learning on Friday.\r\nRecommendation for Board Vote:\r\nOriginally  we were anticipating an improvement in the pandemic situation; however, due to the increase in COVID cases and quarantines, the Administration asks that the Board approve the continuation of the current school schedule through Semester 2. Although the schedule for in person students will remain the same, both buildings will work to allow online students to move to in-person by request. Should the pandemic situation improve, the schedule may be revisited. \r\nB.Quarantine Policy Discussion\r\nVote\tDebbie Deem\t10 m\r\nThe policy has been attached with redlines for Administrative suggested edits.\r\n \r\nDiscussion (The Administration has not made a determination on the following; any decisions made by the Board shall be reflected in the Policy update):\r\nThe CDC/Utah Health Department has recommended reducing the quarantine time for exposure from 14 days to 10 days. Attached is the data we have from the quarantined staff at school related to this timeline.\r\nThe CDC has stated that there is no need to quarantine 90 days after recovering from COVID. \r\nTravel related quarantines in conjunction with any changes to the 14 days or 90 day information.\r\nPolicy Management: Do we want to continue to make all changes dependent of Board vote, or do we want a caveat for change in relation to CDC or Health Department recommendations?\r\nWebsites related to this discussion:\r\nUtah Coronavirus information page: https://coronavirus.utah.gov/protect-yourself/?fbclid=IwAR2zb4ds9QE9mEmVrDInUc7PquQypErq5x-CypDraEoanIsmWIvOiuuaR2Y\r\nCDC: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/duration-isolation.html\r\nAttachments:\r\nEmail from Weber-Morgan Health Department nurse assigned to OPA.\r\nData from survey to quarantined staff.\r\n 6.27.POL COVID-19 Quarantine Policy - Google Docs.pdf\r\n FY21 12-2020 Staft Quarantine Survey - Sheet1.pdf\r\n Quarantine email from Public Health Nurse regarding quarantine time.pdf\r\n\r\nC.Administrative Board Report\r\nDiscuss\tKasey Kennington\t20 m\r\n Administrative Board Report 12.10.2020.pdf\r\n FY21 Safety Review - Sheet1.pdf\r\n LiveScan Fingerprinting Procurement Comparison 11-10-2020.pdf\r\n\r\nD.Executive Session to Discuss Directors' Evaluations and Bonus recommendations.\r\nVote\tWilliam Davis\t5 m\r\nto protect the privacy of an individual.\r\nE.Administrative Fall Evaluations and Bonus Proposal\r\nVote\tWilliam Davis\t5 m\r\nVI.

Requirement - 5 years ago Utah adopted a federal regulation that requires CO detection on all devices that use CO.  The system must be linked with our current Fire System.\r\n \r\n2.  Timeline - Firetrol has informed us that the timeline for completion is 8-12 weeks from start.  Drew have requested a timeline from AAA.\r\n\r\n3.  Scope - A CO detector must be installed in each of the 32 HVAC Units in the Elem and 16 units in the JH.  Each CO detector must have its own redundant Power Supply.  It cannot be added to the current power runs.  All COs must be linked to the fire panel and must be integrated with the alarm system in order to alert monitoring company and authorities of any issues.\r\n \r\n4. Financing - We may capitalize the expenditure.  This would essentially take it from reserves and wouldn't affect the bottom line on the audit all in one year.\r\n  CO Detector Procurement.pdf\r\n\r\nC.Crime Insurance\r\nVote\tDebbie Deem\t5 m\r\nThe Board voted in the June meeting to approve the crime insurance in lieu of the Treasurer's bond up to the increased premium amount of $500. We had not received the actual bid at that time. \r\n \r\nWe have received 2 options. \r\n$526,000 of Employee Theft coverage for $1,951.  The policies provides coverage for:\r\nGovernment entity including Treasurer (covers the position, no need for a specific bond)\r\nFaithful performance of duty (covers claims that the Treasurer didn't faithfully perform duties)\r\nAll employees - provides coverage if any employee who commits theft\r\n$526,000 Employee Theft coverage and only covers the Director, Board Chairman, Board Treasurer and the Business Manager.  It does not cover the other employees.  The premium for this option is $1,275\r\nThe Treasurer's bond premium was $895.  \r\n \r\nThe Utah Money Management Council recommends the Treasurer Bond amounts based upon the budget.  5% of our budget is about $465,000.  $526,000 is on the high side.  It is not recommended to reduce to the $465,000; however, we could lower the premium slightly if we wanted to lower the insured amount, possibly to $490,000 or $500,000.\r\n \r\n  Treasurer Bond Requirements.pdf\r\n\r\nD.Internet circuit upgrade\r\nVote\tAndrew Smith\t\r\nThrough UEN and E-rate, we are adding another circuit fail safe. We have a primary at WSU and the upgrade will give us a back up at UofU.\r\nOne time cost, after discount: $4,107.52.\r\nMonthly cost, after discount: $130.05 for a total of $7,803.00 over 60 months.\r\n  Please_DocuSign_Ogden_Prep_Academy_2020_MOU..pdf\r\n\r\nE.Medical Insurance Adoption and School contribution update\r\nVote\tDebbie Deem\t5 m\r\nWe currently offer Cigna medical insurance. They proposed a 20% premium increase, so we went to bid. Blue Cross/Blue Shield came back with the best rates.  For Dental and Vision, the bids were not as clear. TDA offers a savings to the most employees (35); however, it is a small increase to some (18).\r\nThe difference between Employee + Spouse and Employee + Children is not significant as it has been in the past. \r\nI am proposing we increase the school contribution to the Employee + Children category to $650 to match the Employee + Spouse category. With our current numbers this will cost approximately $6,000 per year.\r\nWe request a vote on the increased contribution.\r\n \r\nI have attached the current insurance costs and the proposed costs under the current benefit package.\r\n  FY21 Employee Insurance Costs - FY20.pdf\r\n  FY21 Employee Insurance Costs - FY21 (1).pdf\r\n  Medical Insurance Options.pdf\r\n\r\nF.Kitchen Equipment Grant\r\nVote\tDebbie Deem\t5 m\r\nWe applied for a Kitchen Equipment grant for $43,902.95.\r\nWe were awarded the grant to purchase the following:\r\nProofer Cabinet ($2,884.85)\r\nHot Food Serving Counter ($3,046.05)\r\nDisposers (2) ($4,346.54)\r\nCombi Oven ($28,027.55)\r\nTables (4) ($5,579.96)\r\n  OPA 2019 Equipment Assistance Grants Application applied 5-2020.pdf\r\n\r\nG.Grant for Wi-Fi upgrade\r\nVote\tAndrew Smith\t5 m\r\nThe UETN received a large grant from CARES for Wifi6 Upgrades. It is a very short project window. We were able to receive the grant to upgrade all of our Wireless Access Points to Wifi6. Unfortunately, the manufacturer that we went with in the E-Rate process does not release their Enterprise Wifi-6 Access Points until the end of 2020. In order to meet the requirements of this grant we had to go with a different manufacturer. This does not affect our E-Rate grant, it only allows us to move our installation schedule up. The LEA (OPA) must follow these project guidelines.\r\nMemorandum of Understanding must be signed by July 31st, 2020.\r\nProducts must be purchased by July 31st, 2020\r\nProducts must be installed and fully operational by December 30th, 2020.\r\nLEA (OPA) must purchase products and verify delivery before reimbursement can be provided.\r\nThere are weekly meetings and milestones that must be met throughout the entire project. I will be working closely with UETN to complete the project in the appropriate manner.\r\nIn addition to all Wireless Access Points being upgraded to Wifi6, UETN and USBE are working to standardize Wireless Monitoring. They are providing each LEA that was awarded this funding, a Wireless Monitoring System provided by Ekahau.\r\nThe total cost for the project is as follows:\r\nWireless Improvements - $76,317.74\r\na. 50 Meraki MR46 Wifi6 Access Points\r\nb. 13 Meraki MR56 Wifi6 Access Points\r\nc. 3 Meraki MR776-HW Outdoor Access Points\r\nd. 66 Meraki 6 Year Enterprise Licenses\r\nEkahau Package - $10,785.00\r\na. Ekahau Pro Suite\r\nb. Ekahau Sidekick\r\nc. 36 Months of Support\r\nd. 2 License seats for training through UEN.\r\nTotal Cost - $87,102.74\r\nThe way the E-Rate deal is structured, we have some flexibility with both product that we purchase, and timeframe of when we purchase.\r\nDue to the short window of opportunity and requirements of the funding project, and the fact that NetDiverse was selected for the E-Rate project of which this is an extension, we would like to use NetDiverse as the Service Provider for this project as well. NetDiverse is the only Service provider in Utah with Meraki Deal Registration on this deal, so they will receive the best discount for product.\r\nWe have a history of working with NetDiverse and they are currently our Tier 3 Support Provider. Attached is the NetDiverse Quote that was submitted as an estimate to UETN for the project.\r\nIf approved, the project will be completed by August 16th, 2020, and Ogden Preparatory Academy will have a fully operational Wifi6 Network for the 2020-2021 School Year.\r\n  OPA-Meraki AP Quote.pdf\r\n\r\nH.GEERs funding and CARES funding adjustments\r\nVote\tDebbie Deem\t5 m\r\nI.Cleaning and Sanitization Supply Ordering\r\nFYI\tDebbie Deem\t5 m\r\nIV. School Update\t5:10 PM\r\nA.School Reopening Plan\r\nVote\tStephanie Mathers\t20 m\r\nB.Utah Parent Center Annual Agreement\r\nVote\tElizabeth Callison\t5 m\r\nWe have contracted with the Utah Parent Center previously to provide support to families of students with special needs. The proposed contract is for the 2020-21 school year at a cost of $3,328. This is increased from $2,585 for the 2019-20 school year due to a reduction in their consortium. \r\nWhile the cost is not significant, we are requesting Board approval of the third party contract.\r\n \r\n  Ogden Prepatory Academy 2020-21.pdf\r\n\r\nC.AVID Officer Training\r\nFYI\tStephanie Mathers\t5 m\r\nKaren Eilander plans to hold an AVID officer training. It will include 4 students, 2 adults, outside with social distancing.\r\nNo vote required. Board discussion to determine if concerns exist.\r\nD.Quarantine Requirements for employees leaving the state or country.\r\nDiscuss\tDebbie Deem\t5 m\r\nV.

rolling average over 16% and increasing; can't really make much movement at this meeting\r\nJenniferGL - SL District meets today with Health Dept to discuss possibly changing metrics; pressure to get students back in; SLArts Board is not looking to change metrics today; district policy puts pressure on SLArts\r\nJohn - Some schools are not testing / tracing / reporting; metrics may be underreported\r\nJenniferGL - Don't know about lag time in reporting on SL County website, but data are shown by school; noted that some (public and private) are not listed that she knows have cases\r\nHeather - Money is being allocated for teachers to get tested with or without symptoms; right now teachers are not comfortable with being back in the building with kids; still getting a handle on schedule - always adjustment time, plus online, plus learning curves, plus windstorms\r\nJenniferGL - Question about why would we change metrics:  Recognize that there are pressures to change metrics and we may need to adjust in the future\r\n\r\n\r\n5.\tRemote Learning Feedback\t\t\t\tHeather Shepherd\t\t3:45\r\n\r\nTeachers\r\nStudents and Families\r\n'Tweaks' and Adjustments\r\n\r\nHeather - Reviewed Teacher Survey (in handouts); still getting more teacher responses\r\nDiscussed trends; two topics included Friday Bookclubs and teachers feeling overwhelmed, partly by grading duties\r\nJohn - Are some teachers available to provide Friday bookclubs or other activities?\r\nKaty - Meeting Monday to discuss Parent Connections Survey (144 responses so far) to get some things set up - possibilities are informal parent organized activities, teacher-led connection activities, paid After-School-type activities\r\nStacey - Can parents somehow help with helping enter grades\r\nHeather - No, it's private information; we are brainstorming ways to help decrease grading time\r\nJohn - Can we hire an intern to enter data\r\nHeather - We can look into; privacy issue\r\n\r\nKaty - Admin and support staff are constantly in communication with families and helping troubleshoot; may need to do some fine tuning on schedule if online goes on for a long time, but not right now; the longer we are in remote, the more we learn we need to help our kids socially and emotionally and we are working to help with that\r\nJenniferGL - Commend faculty/staff for the thoughtful and intentional work going into this, and appreciates that we are not changing course routinely to address individual voices\r\nMoni - We bought 100 Chromebooks but taking a while to come in; some of our older ones are giving families trouble; also getting 100 hotspots that should arrive in about 2 weeks; we are trying hard\r\nMatt - Heard from a parent of 5th grader who was appreciative of faculty/staff reaching out to support\r\nHeather - All our 5th graders have Mindfulness with Holly; Holly is hearing a lot from them and she hears of struggles but more and more the positives; Holly is a very safe place; we do really care and the students have a place to talk and share\r\n\r\n\r\n6.\tCommittee Updates\r\n\r\nFinance\r\nMoni - shared handouts - provided overview\r\nWe applied for everything we could for Covid support amounting to $130,000 (restricted in use)\r\nAnnual reporting is up to date\r\n\r\nConstruction\r\nMoni - On time, at or under budget\r\nWill be done by end of month; starting to clean\r\nIf money leftover, might consider upgrading lights/electrical; change to LEDs?  But ~$30,000\r\nFence area by sycamore trees; cannot raise dirt/mulch without damaging trees\r\nThe trees survived the windstorm\r\nTrying to get waiver to enclose bushes within fence\r\nJenniferGL - any money available to make an outdoor classroom?  Open air structure with roof?\r\nMoni - Can rig up sails for shade canopy?  (She bought 3) - This is cheap; can buy many\r\nHeather - Would be nice if we could do something that kids could be in within rain and snow \r\n\r\nGovernance - Nomination of Suyin Chong, to be considered for Governing Board\r\nJenGL - Leanne Hawken has been nominated but not formally voted; Suyin has pending nomination\r\nBoth will serve on Committees prior to a formal vote later in the fall\r\nWould someone like to formally nominate Suyin?\r\n\r\nMOTION:  To nominate Suyin Choong to be considered to join the Governing Board\r\nStacey Mahan moved to approve\r\nJohn Bakken seconded\r\nMotion approved unanimously\r\n\r\nJenniferGL - More context:\r\nWe had lost a few board members at beginning of year and are seeking replacements, we are reviewing applications, plus there is training\r\nAs a Committee we have worked on ability to provide oversight of Moni and Heather, and on leadership, communication; plus some issues to be discussed in closed session\r\nIf any questions, please ask her, Lon, John, Melissa (Governing Committee)\r\nOptimistic about moving forward, everyone has been working very hard; thank you to Heather for patience and understanding - we have been a little hard on her as we are learning, too\r\nNew board committee soon?  Construction and Transition Committees coming to a close; possibly new School Improvement Committee proposed by Heather\r\nHeather - Important for our school to have certain goals\r\nJulie L has agreed to head up new committee, with Leanne, other Board member(s), and three teachers\r\nRepresentative of academics and arts; look at data, assessment numbers, growth of students - plus standards of excellence, whole child, etc.; how do we describe and report; how do we compare RISE assessments with 'nothing' from last year? \r\nJenniferGL - Anyone is welcome to participate on a committee - do not need to be a board member\r\nHave talked about a 'Vision' committee, but may not be the time right now - maybe in a year; build on survey from three years ago\r\nTraining - Offering training today - 18 minute video on Open Public Meetings for new board members; trying to incorporate trainings into Board Meeting time, especially withmore meetings than usual\r\n\r\nDevelopment and Community Outreach\t\r\nMelissa - Look at Community Outreach; Katy put out a parent survey; great start for how to engage safely; people are craving connection; we are trying to figure out in this weird Covid environment; we are an arts school - hope we can be creative!\r\nKaty - 30-40 parents have said they would like to help out - great level of engagement!!  We will make shared SLArts shared Google Calendar to add/find activities to engage families in our SLArts community\r\nDevelopment - $7500 from Sorensen Legacy Foundation; developing Annual Campaign materials currently; this year, bold goal to combine Annual Campaign with SLArts 24; kick off in late October\r\n\r\n\r\n7.\tOpen and Public Meetings Training by video\tAll\t\t\t\t4:05\r\n\r\nKaty will stay on now to host video, then John B will start new session for closed meeting (must be recorded)\r\n\r\n(Video was viewed)\r\n\r\nMOTION:  For the Governing Board to move into a Closed Session\r\nJohn Bakken moved to approve\r\nMatt Nelson seconded\r\nIndividual Votes taken to approve:\r\nStacey Mahan, Julie Livers, John Bakken, Melissa Block, Jennifer Goldman-Luthy, Matt Nelson, Annaliese Booher, Rob Scott, all in favor\r\nMotion approved\r\n\r\n\r\n8.\tClosed Session\t\t\t\t\tBoard Members\t\t4:25\r\n\r\nThe Board may move into closed session to discuss items allowed under the Utah Open and Public Meetings Law.
