For Jackie Rawlins and her family, the beginning of 2020 seemed like the perfect time for a new beginning.  They moved to Utah from Idaho in March, excited for a new chapter. Then COVID-19 upended the world.  &ldquo;It was a weird time for everybody, trying to figure out what that meant,&rdquo; said Rawlins.  Jackie Rawlins says she picked Monticello Academy primarily because of a high tech air-flow system that the school had recently added to its HVAC system. (KUTV)
